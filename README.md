[3D Slicer](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer) is an open-source medical software platform.

## Objective

The goal is to develop a platform for Neuro-sama (or any other LLM using the Neuro API) to control actions in 3D Slicer in defined procedures.

Further integration of robotic devices with 3D Slicer to conduct virtual in addition to simulated procedures is also intended.

## Installation

Download and install [3D Slicer](https://slicer.org) (tested on 5.10.0). Clone repository. Add module directory to 3D Slicer via Edit -> Application Settings -> Modules. Specific procedures may require scenes.
